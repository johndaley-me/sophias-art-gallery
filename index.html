            <h3>Arctic Fox</h3>
            <p>This is a picture of the Artic Fox, also called the snow fox, white fox,
              or polar fox. Artic Foxes are found throughout the artic tundra. Their
              soft, extravagant fur is white in winter, where they can blend into
              the snowscape.</p>

            <h3>Asian Elephant</h3>
            <p> A large amount of male asian elephants do not have tusks, although here
              I have chosen to draw one with tusks. Asian Elephants are smaller than
              African elephants, and their ears are smaller compared to their body.
              Just like all elephants, they use their trunks to soak up or hold up
              to 8 liters of water, as shown here.</p>

          <figure> <img src="blue-swirl.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Blue Swirl</h3>
            <p> I drew this picture for a class art project, and I had to come up with
              some of my own patterns. I made the triangle design in the corner of
              the first petal on the left. Some of these zentangles, however, were
              not my own idea. I found them off of some websites that displayed different
              patterns.</p>

            <h3>Natalie's Fantatic Floral</h3>
            <p> I named this piece for my sister Natalie. I thought this picture represented
              her so welll. The swirls and patterns in the background illuistrating
              her bright, outgoing personality, and the flowers in the middle her
              ideas, blooming with creativity.</p>

            <h3>French Poodle</h3>
            <p>I tried to draw this picture to look like french poodle, although there
              are several types of poodles. I did draw this picture quite fast, as
              you may observe the sloppy backdrop. I mostly try to spend a bit more
              time on my pictures, but I decided to put this one in my gallery, regardless
              of the fact that it looks a bit sloppy compared to other pieces. </p>

            <h3>Porcupine at Midnight </h3>
            <p> I made this picture of a crested porcupine just outside of a forest.
              You can see the moon, which I tried to look bright, but it didn't turn
              out too well. </p>

            <h3>My Tree</h3>
            <p>In this picture,I decided to draw a picture of the tree in my front yard.
              I enjoy climbing this tree when i need to calm down or need to relax.
              I climb my tree when my room, which is directly by the kitchen and
              living space, does not offer enough quiet for me to work on a project,
              think, or read. I can climb to the very top, where I can poke my head
              out above the layer of leaves and branches. I also use this play as
              a hangout space with my friends in my neighborhood, where my 5-year
              old brother cannot get to us.</p>

            <h3>Sperm Whale</h3>
            <p> This is a picture of a sperm whale. I thought it would be cool to add
              a whale to my colllection of ocean creatures. I am planning on drawing
              a dolphin soon to add to this collection.</p>

          <figure> <img src="bald-eagle.jpg" alt="Bald Eagle">
            <h3>Bald Eagle</h3>
            <p> This was my very first drawing in my sketchbook. I was around eight years
              old when I drew this picture. </p>

            <h3>Zentangled Whale</h3>
            <p>I drew this whale for a sign I was making with my friend. I enjoy making
              crafts, especially projects where I get to paint or draw.</p>

          <figure> <img src="seahorse.jpg" alt="Seahorse">
            <h3>Seahorse</h3>
            <p>I drew this picture of a male seahorse when I was 10 years old. I thought
              it was cool that seahorses hold on to each other with their tails so
              they aren't swept away by the current.</p>

          <figure> <img src="horse.jpg" alt="Horse">
            <h3>Horse</h3>
            <p> This is a picture of a American Hanoverian horse. After I saw a picture
              of this type of horse, I decided It would be cool to have a picture
              like it in my sketchbook. I have only drawn the rough draft of the
              piece here, but I decided it would be best to show what some of my
              drafts look like in my gallery. I am currently working on finishing
              this piece. </p>

          <figure> <img src="wolf.jpg" alt="Red Wolf">
            <h3>Red Wolf</h3>
            <p>Here I have drawn a picture of a Red Wolf. I saw a red wolf on the front
              cover of one of the books I was reading and I thought it looked really
              fun to draw.</p>
          </figure>
          <figure> <img src="kitten.jpg" alt="Kitten">
            <h3>Kitten</h3>
            <p> I drew this picture of a kitten for my little sister who loves cats.
              She enjoys playing kittens with me.</p>

            <h3> Eiffel Tower </h3>
            <p>You can see here I have a drawing of the Eiffel Tower located in Paris,France.
              It took a bit of time to figure out how i was going to draw the bars
              and details, but I think it turned out fine.</p>

            <h3> Caribbean Flamingo</h3>
            <p>Like many other flamingos, the carribean flamingo is born with grey feathers.
              Their diet of brine shrimp and blue-green algae naturally dies their
              feathers pink</p>

          <figure> <img src="pig.jpg" alt="Pig">
            <h3>Pig</h3>
            <p> As you may know, I enjoy drawing animals. I decided to draw this pig
              because I don't have really any animals drawn that aren't wild or house
              pets. I thought it would add something unique to my collection.</p>
